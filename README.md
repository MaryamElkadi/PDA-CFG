# PDA-CFG

This project involves solving a set of Pushdown Automata (PDA) and Context-Free Grammar (CFG) problems using Java. For each problem, we are required to:

Design CFG Rules for the context-free grammar problems.
Design PDA for the PDA problems, including the state diagram.
Implement Java solutions that simulate the behavior of the CFG and PDA based on the given input.
Handle input and output via text files, where the program processes the input from one text file and outputs the results in one output file.
This project will help you understand the applications of Context-Free Grammars (CFG) in language recognition and Pushdown Automata (PDA) in handling languages with a single stack.

Features
# 1. Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
Each CFG problem will require the design of a set of production rules.
The Java program will read input from a file and simulate a derivation based on the given CFG rules.
The output will indicate whether the given input string can be derived from the CFG.
# 2. Pushdown Automata (PDA)
For PDA problems, you will design a Pushdown Automaton and draw the corresponding PDA diagram (showing states, stack symbols, and transitions).
The Java program will simulate the PDA behavior, checking if the input string is accepted or rejected based on PDA rules.
The output will indicate whether the input string is accepted or rejected by the PDA.
# 3. Input & Output Files
The Java program will read one input text file containing the input data for all the problems.
The program will produce an output text file containing the results of processing each problem in the specified format.
